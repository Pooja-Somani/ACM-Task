# ACM-Task
I have created a basic login system using PHP. The structure is created using simple HTML and CSS with Bootstrap features. A user can create an account and login using those credentials. It checks for duplicate usernames, existing users, invalid credentials and display a warning accordingly. After validation, a registered user is directed to the home page displaying the welcome message. From there, he can log out. If a user directly tries to access the home page with the url, we redirect him to the login page.
We need a XAMP server to execute the project, after starting Apache and MySQL modules on their respective port. We access phpMyAdmin at the url:"http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/sql&db=users&table=users&pos=0" which stores our database containing the details of all the registered users. We can execute any SQL query using this GUI interface and keep track of all the users. Any new registration done through the signup.php is reflected in our database, using which the user can login any time in the future.
